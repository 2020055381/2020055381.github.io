				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>Last summer, I’m so glad that I had an opportunity to go to <a href="https://www.france.fr/en">France</a> as an exchange student for fourteen days. I not only could meet many new friends, but also had an amazing time there.
 				</p>
				<p>The exchange tour has been a very rewarding and pleasant experience for us. Now, we are going to share the ones that we think are the most unforgettable parts in France.</p>

				<p>Let’s start with the first day. After, our plane touched down on the Bordeaux Airport. We had a little bit nervous, when we were being with the French students. Even, they were the group which came to our school last year. </p>
				<p>Actually, we wanted to chat with them, but our brain just ran blank and we had nothing to say. However, after we played some games like “red light, green light” and “hide-and-seek” with each other on a garden called Chateau. We became closer and started to share ours school lives.</p>
				<p>One day later, we could experience the school lives that they just shared. It was a quite big difference to Hong Kong. We divided by two teams ,having a lesson with them.</p>
				<p>In the Mathematics class, I was so stupid that I couldn’t solve the math problem. But, Kurtis kept laughing at me. See! On that photo, there was a girl helping me. She was so nice. That’s what Kurtis should be.</p>

				<p>Sorry Tim it’s not going to be happen. Then, the next place is Saint Emilion. Before, we went sightseeing, we found a place covered in grass and sat in a circle having a picnic. We enjoyed the moment.</p>
				<p>After lunch, we went to the top, we could see the best view of this place, with fascinating Romanesque churches and ruins stretching all along steep and narrow streets.</p>
				<p>It was the last day to be with French students, we went to Pyla Sand Dune which is the tallest sand dune in Europe. The sand were too soft, making us difficult to climb. We had tried our best.</p>
				<p>Across the sand hill, we came to a beach. The French students had prepared lunch for us. It was delicious. Just then, we took a rest and had a drink there. We also exchanged ours Facebook, IG or Snapchat.</p>
				<p>In conclusion, doing this exchange was definitely a life-rewarding experience to us, and the benefit was long-lasting. I would recommend my fellow schoolmates to go for exchange, because it would greatly broaden your horizons and develop your international exposure.</p>
